# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

# Section 2: Make a plot

```{r basic plot}
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000, sd = .5),
  y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm(1000)
)

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

# Section 3: Learning Assessment

```{r exercise}
exercise_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(500, mean=1),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric>0,
  vec_abs = abs(vec_numeric)
)

ggplot(exercise_df, aes(x = vec_abs)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

* The mean is `r mean(samp)`.

* The median is `r median(samp)`.

* The standard deviation is `r sd(samp)`.
